I can’t build and send you a .mph file from here, but I can give you a complete, exact recipe you can follow in COMSOL to produce the model in under 10–15 minutes — or copy/paste if you have LiveLink/COMSOL Java. Below I give:
	1.	A short checklist (quick copy‑paste) so you can reproduce the model quickly in the GUI.
	2.	A detailed step‑by‑step with the exact values, menu names and what to click.
	3.	An optional note about a MATLAB/LiveLink or Java (COMSOL API) automation option I can provide if you want to auto‑generate the .mph.

Pick whichever you prefer. If you want, after you run the steps you can tell me any error messages or screenshots and I’ll debug.

⸻

1) Quick checklist (copy this into a note and follow it in COMSOL)
	•	Model Wizard → 2D (cartesian) ← recommended (left side is not axis)
	•	Geometry: Rectangle width = 0.08 m, height = 0.14 m. Add Points on left edge at (0, 0.04) and (0, 0.10) and Build/Partition so left boundary splits into three segments.
	•	Materials: rho = 7850[kg/m^3], Cp = 460[J/(kg*K)], k = 52[W/(m*K)].
	•	Physics: Heat Transfer in Solids (ht). Domain Q = 0 (default).
	•	BC: Top/Right/Bottom → Temperature 273.15[K]. Left boundary segments top & bottom → Thermal Insulation. Middle left segment between z=0.04 and 0.10 → Heat Flux q0 = 5e5[W/m^2] (if sign is wrong, use -5e5).
	•	Initial value: 293.15[K].
	•	Mesh: Physics controlled → Finer. Add a Size feature on the left patch with Maximum element size = 0.003 m. Build mesh.
	•	Study: 1) Stationary → Compute. 2) Time Dependent, Time range 0:1:60 → Compute.
	•	Results: Surface & Contour plots; Derived Values → Point Evaluation at A,B,C; 1D Plot Group → Line Graph for required lines; export CSV if needed.

If you want the axisymmetric model instead, do Model Wizard → 2D Axisymmetric and use r‑coordinate as left→right; the BC splitting procedure is the same.

2) Detailed step‑by‑step GUI instructions (exact clicks & values)

A. Start new model
	1.	Launch COMSOL Multiphysics.
	2.	Model Wizard:
	•	Step 1: Select 2D (choose 2D not axisymmetric unless you are sure this is axisymmetric). Click Next.
	•	Step 2: From Physics > Heat Transfer, choose Heat Transfer in Solids (ht). Click Add then Study: select Stationary. Click Finish.

Why 2D: The figure shows a planar cross section; the left face has a flux patch — 2D Cartesian is the simplest and avoids axis confusion.

B. Geometry (create rectangle and split left boundary)
	1.	In Model Builder click Geometry 1.
	2.	Set Unit = m.
	3.	Right‑click Geometry 1 → Rectangle:
	•	Width: 0.08
	•	Height: 0.14
	•	Position x = 0, y = 0
	•	Click Build Selected.
	4.	Now we need to split the left boundary at z=0.04 and z=0.10:
	•	Right‑click Geometry 1 → Points → Point (or from the toolbar choose Point).
	•	Create point at (x=0, y=0.04) → Add.
	•	Create point at (x=0, y=0.10) → Add.
	•	Select both points (you may need to hit Build Selected after creating them).
	•	Now right‑click Geometry 1 → Form Union or Partition Objects / Boolean and choose to Build All. COMSOL will create boundary fragments where the points lie, splitting the left boundary into three boundary edges: bottom (0→0.04), middle (0.04→0.10), top (0.10→0.14).
	•	If partitioning is unclear in your COMSOL version: alternative method — create three rectangles stacked and combine with Union: rectangle1 (0→0.14), then rectangle2 etc. but the point split is easiest.
	5.	Build All.

Check in the Graphics window: left boundary should now show 3 selectable edges.

⸻

C. Material properties
	1.	Right‑click Materials → Add Material → Blank Material.
	2.	Under the material node set the following (enter units explicitly):
	•	Density: 7850[kg/m^3]
	•	Specific heat capacity: 460[J/(kg*K)]
	•	Thermal conductivity: 52[W/(m*K)]
	3.	Make sure the material is assigned to the domain (Domain 1).

⸻

D. Physics: Heat Transfer in Solids
	1.	In Model Builder, click Heat Transfer in Solids (ht).
	2.	Under Heat Transfer → Domains → Domain 1: check the volumetric heat source Q. It should be 0[W/m^3] (default).
	3.	Initial Values (in physics node) — set Temperature to 293.15[K].

⸻

E. Boundary Conditions (exact menu items & values)

1. Top, bottom, right as Dirichlet T = 273.15 K
	•	In Heat Transfer (ht): right‑click Heat Transfer in Solids → Temperature.
	•	In the Graphics select the Top, Right, and Bottom edges (hold Ctrl to multi‑select).
	•	In the settings window Temperature enter 273.15[K]. Click Apply.

2. Left boundary segments
	•	Select the left edge top segment (z>0.10) and the left edge bottom segment (z<0.04): set them to Thermal Insulation.
	•	In Heat Transfer add Thermal Insulation and select those two edges (or use default Thermal Insulation (no condition)).
	•	Select the middle left segment (z from 0.04 to 0.10):
	•	Right‑click Heat Transfer → Heat Flux.
	•	In the settings for the selected boundary Heat Flux: set Heat flux (q0) = 5e5[W/m^2].
	•	Important sign note: If after solving you see the solution cooler near the flux, set q0 = -5e5[W/m^2] — COMSOL sometimes interprets q0 as outward flux so outward positive means negative into domain. If uncertain run stationary and check direction: temperatures should go up near the band.
	•	Click Apply.

⸻

F. Mesh (recommended settings)
	1.	Right‑click Mesh 1 → Free Triangular → Size.
	2.	Choose Finer or User controlled and:
	•	Add a Size node (Right‑click Mesh 1 → Size → Boundary selection).
	•	Select the middle left boundary (the flux patch) and set Maximum element size = 0.003, Minimum element size = 5e-5 (or keep default), Curvature factor default. This concentrates elements near the flux.
	3.	Click Build All.

⸻

G. Studies and Solving

1. Stationary
	•	In Study 1 ensure Stationary is added. Click Compute.
	•	Check the solution: Surface plot of T (Temperature). The highest T should be near the flux region.

2. Time dependent (transient)
	•	Right‑click Study → Add Study Step → Time Dependent. (Or create a new study: Study → Add Study → Time Dependent).
	•	For the Time Dependent node click Study Settings → set Times to range(0,1,60) or simply 0:1:60 (gives steps every 1 s up to 60 s). If you want solver to pick steps use 0 60.
	•	Initial value should be 293.15 K (or use stationary solution as initial if you want to start at steady). Typically use the given initial 293.15 K.
	•	Click Compute. COMSOL will produce time‑series solution.

⸻

H. Probes / Derived Values (temperatures at A/B/C)

Option A — Probes (live)
	1.	Right‑click Results → Probes → Point Probe.
	2.	Create a probe at coordinates:
	•	A: x = 0.04, y = 0.04
	•	B: x = 0.06, y = 0.07
	•	C: x = 0.06, y = 0.10
	3.	For transient study, the Probe plot will show T vs time. You can right‑click each Probe and Add to Plot Group.

Option B — Derived Values (export final numbers)
	1.	Under Results → Derived Values → Point Evaluation:
	•	Add one Point Evaluation for coordinates above, evaluate T.
	•	For transient study choose dataset for final time (use dataset Solution 1 (t = 60 s) or similar).
	•	Click Evaluate to get numeric values, then click Export → save CSV.

⸻

I. Line plots (temperature profiles requested)

Axial lines (z direction) at fixed r
	•	Right‑click Results → More Derived Values → Line Evaluation (or create 1D Plot Group → Line Graph).
	•	For a line at r = 0.05: set Start Point = (0.05, 0.0), End point = (0.05, 0.14), Number of points = 200. Evaluate T.
	•	Repeat for r = 0.08, r = 0.10 — note if r=0.10 is outside domain (domain ends at 0.08) you cannot use it. Check problem text: maybe those were z-locations not r. If a requested line is outside domain adjust accordingly.

Radial lines (r direction) at fixed z
	•	Create Line Evaluation: Start = (0, z), End = (0.08, z). Use z = 0.03, 0.05, 0.07.

Plot or export these lines.

⸻

J. Contours & Surface plots
	•	In Results: add 2D Plot Group → Surface for surface render. Or Contour to get isotherms. Set number of levels, show color legend.
	•	For transient you can pick the dataset for time step you want (e.g., t = 60 s). Also add animation for time evolution.

⸻

K. Exporting numeric results and plots
	•	To export point/time series: Derived Values → Export → Data and choose CSV.
	•	To export plot image: right‑click plot → Save Image → set resolution & file type.
	•	To make a PDF report: File → Report and include selected results.

⸻

3) Sign / sanity checks
	•	After stationary run: the steady temperature distribution should have T between 273.15 (edges) and a higher peak near the flux patch (but not extremely high if conduction carries heat away).
	•	If results look inverted (cold at flux), change sign of heat flux in BC (use -5e5).
	•	If transient is too stiff or slow, reduce time step size. For large flux strong gradients may require smaller time steps.
